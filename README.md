# Tank Level Control with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements classical and temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning algorithms to control the water level in a tank using simulation-based methods.

## Objective

Maintain the tank water level within a safe operating range by:
- Modeling tank dynamics (inflow, outflow, balance),
- Learning optimal control strategies using Q-learning or TD-learning,
- Minimizing system response time and preventing overflow.
